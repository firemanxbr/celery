# Introduction

Challenge proposed by Veriff to Senior Python Engineer position to calculate the value of the average face embedding vector across a large dataset of faces/photos.

## Master Node

The master node is a concept, in this challenge, that will be a container to orchestrate everything necessary to set up the tools, queue tasks, etc.. to other containers that will process the face embedding vector across a large dataset of faces.

**Note:** Regarding the size of this challenge, only one container as a master node will be necessary to process in a reasonable time. For bigger environments with a huge dataset will be necessary parallelization in the methods to acquire the dataset.
